# ChargeMan
Manage Windows PC charging via Bluetooth

# Function
- At first, Connect the mini plug to the PC charger.
- This application maintains your computer's charge level at approximately 80%.
- Specifically, it turns the mini plug on when the charge falls below 78% and off when it exceeds 81%.
- It will not function unless the application is running while the PC is powered on. Therefore, if you plan to put the PC into sleep mode or turn it off, please disconnect the charging cable.
- To exit the application, you can also right-click the icon displayed in the system tray at the bottom right.

# Effect
By consistently maintaining the charge level at 80%, it is expected to reduce battery wear and extend its lifespan.
Whether this is true or not is unclear.

# Note
- Bluetooth plug I use is SwitchBot mini Plug.
- Plase change the DEVICE_MAC(Plug's MAC Address) in the Code.
- You can find the MAC Address from SwitchBot app of smartphone.
